### Problem Introduction
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics or patterns, allowing companies to market their products to each group effectively and significantly.

In business-to-consumer marketing, most companies typically segment their customers by Age, Gender, Marital Status, Location (urban, suburban, rural), Life Stage (single, married, divorced, no family, retired, etc.).

Segmentation allows marketers to gain better insights into products and identify ways to improve existing products or new product/service opportunities, establish better customer relationships, focus on the most profitable customers, and more.

In this problem, we will use the K-Means algorithm to analyze and address the "Customer Segmentation for Loan Approval" problem using the R language.
